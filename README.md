# Snake Game Project 🎮🐍  

This repository contains a **console-based Snake Game** developed using C++ as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey. The project leverages **linked lists**, **dynamic memory management**, and **custom game mechanics** to provide an engaging and interactive experience.  

## Features 🌟  
- **Game Modes:**  
  - Simple Level  
  - Speed increases after every 3 scores  
  - Obstacles increase after every 3 scores  
  - Combined mode: Speed and obstacles increase together  

- **Core Components:**  
  - **Snake Implementation**: Built using a linked list to manage the snake's body dynamically.  
  - **Dynamic Obstacles**: Obstacles increase based on score to add challenges.  
  - **Customizable Gameplay**: Different modes offer varying levels of difficulty and fun.  

- **Efficient Console Manipulation:**  
  Utilizes `windows.h` for dynamic console control and seamless game rendering.  

## Learning Highlights 📚  
This project helped me:  
1. Understand and apply **linked lists** in real-world scenarios.  
2. Enhance my skills in **dynamic memory allocation** and **pointers**.  
3. Explore **game development** fundamentals with structured and reusable code.  

## How to Play 🚀  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Compile and run the code using any C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).  
3. Use **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** to control the snake's movement.  
4. Avoid obstacles, don't hit the walls or yourself, and aim for the highest score!  

## Future Enhancements 🔮  
- Implementing a **high-score leaderboard**.  
- Adding support for **multiplayer mode**.  
- Porting the game to a graphical interface.
